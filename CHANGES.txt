4.0.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- Replaced deprecated ``zope.interface.classProvides`` usage with equivalent
  ``zope.interface.provider`` decorator.

- Replaced deprecated ``zope.interface.implements`` usage with equivalent
  ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.

- Dropped support for Python 2.4 and 2.5.

- Added a vote method to Mailer implementations to allow them to abort a
  transaction if it is known to be unsafe.

- Prevented fatal errors in mail delivery causing potential database corruption.

- Added not declared, but needed test dependency on `zope.component [test]`.

- Added handling for unicode usernames and passwords, encoding them to UTF-8.
  Fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope.sendmail/+bug/597143

- Gave the background queue processor thread a name.

3.7.5 (2012-05-23)
------------------

- Ensured that the 'queuedDelivery' directive has the same discriminator
  as the 'directDelivery' directive (they are mutually incompatible).
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope.sendmail/+bug/191143

- Avoid requeuing messages after an SMTP "recipients refused" error.
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope.sendmail/+bug/1003288

3.7.4 (2010-10-01)
------------------

- Handle unicode usernames and passwords, encoding them to UTF-8. Fix for
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope.sendmail/+bug/597143

3.7.3 (2010-09-25)
------------------

- Added not declared, but needed test dependency on `zope.component [test]`.

3.7.2 (2010-04-30)
------------------

- Removed no longer required testing dependency on zope.testing.

- Maildir storage for queue can now handle unicode passed in for message or
  to/from addresses (change backported from repoze.sendmail).

- Tests use stdlib doctest instead of zope.testing.doctest.

3.7.1 (2010-01-13)
------------------

- Backward compatibility import of zope.sendmail.queue.QueueProcessorThread in
  zope.sendmail.delivery.

3.7.0 (2010-01-12)
------------------

- Removed dependency on ``zope.security``: the security support is optional,
  and only available if the ``zope.security`` package is available. This change
  is similar to the optional security support introduced in ``zope.component``
  3.8.0, and in fact it uses the same helpers.

- Sort by modification time the messages in zope.sendmail.maildir so earlier
  messages are sent before later messages during queue processing.

- Added the new parameter ``processorThread`` to the queuedDelivery ZCML
  directive: if False, the QueueProcessorThread is not started and thus an
  independent process must process the queue; it defaults to True for b/c.

- Provide a console script ``zope-sendmail`` which can be used to process the
  delivery queue in case processorThread is False. The console script can
  either process the messages in the queue once, or run in "daemon" mode.

3.6.1 (2009-11-16)
------------------

- Depend on ``zope.component`` >= 3.8.0, which supports the new semantic of
  zope.component.zcml.proxify needed by zope.sendmail.zcml.

3.6.0 (2009-09-14)
------------------

- Use simple vocabulary factory function instead of custom `UtilityTerm`
  and `UtilityVocabulary` classes, copied from ``zope.app.component`` in
  the previous release.

- Depend on the ``transaction`` package instead of ``ZODB3``.

- Remove zcml slugs and zpkg-related files.

- Work around problem when used with Python >=2.5.1.  See
  https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/zope.sendmail/+bug/413335 .

3.5.1 (2009-01-26)
------------------

- Copied over the UtilityTerm and UtilityVocabulary implementation from
  zope.app.component to avoid a dependency.

- Work around a problem when smtp quit fails, the mail was considered not
  delivered where just the quit failed.

3.5.0 (2008-07-05)
------------------

- final release (identical with 3.5.0b2)

3.5.0b2 (2007-12-19)
--------------------

- If the SMTP server rejects a message (for example, when the sender or
  recipient address is malformed), that email stays in the queue forever
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/157104).

3.5.0b1 (2007-11-08)
--------------------

- Added README.txt
- Can now talk to servers that don't implement EHLO
- Fix bug that caused files with very long names to be created
- Fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/157104: move aside mail that's
  causing 5xx server responses.


3.5.0a2 (2007-10-23)
--------------------

- Cleaned up ``does_esmtp`` in faux SMTP connection classes provided by the
  tests.
- If the ``QueueProcessorThread`` is asked to stop while sending messages, do
  so after sending the current message; previously if there were many, many
  messages to send, the thread could stick around for quite a while.


3.5.0a1 (2007-10-23)
--------------------

- ``QueueProcessorThread`` now accepts an optional parameter *interval* for
  defining how often to process the mail queue (default is 3 seconds)

- Several ``QueueProcessorThreads`` (either in the same process, or multiple
  processes) can now deliver messages from a single maildir without duplicates
  being sent.


3.4.0 (2007-08-20)
--------------------

- Bugfix: Don't keep open files around for every email message
  to be sent on transaction commit.  People who try to send many emails
  in a single transaction now will not run out of file descriptors.


3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
--------------------

Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to ``zope.sendmail``
from Zope 3.4.0a1.
